# 🌐 Final Networking Project – Tomer Glik

This project file (`final project tomer glik.pkt`) was created using **Cisco Packet Tracer** as part of a final assignment. It demonstrates core networking concepts and best practices through a simulated network environment.
This asssignmant is a part of the CCNA preperation.

## 📦 Project Overview

The topology includes:
- Multiple LAN segments
- Routers, switches, and PCs
- Static and/or dynamic routing (e.g., RIP, OSPF)
- VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN routing
- DHCP server configuration (if included)
- Firewall or ACL simulation
- NAT configuration (if present)

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Understand network segmentation and IP addressing
- Configure and troubleshoot routing protocols
- Practice secure network design (ACLs/VLANs/NAT)
- Simulate client-server communication
- Demonstrate end-to-end packet flow and routing behavior

## 🛠 Tools Used

- ✅ Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x recommended)
- 🧮 Subnetting planning (manual / VLSM)
- 📝 CLI configuration of routers and switches

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open `final project tomer glik.pkt` using Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Review the topology layout
3. Open CLI for each router/switch to view or modify configuration
4. Use simulation mode to track packet flow
5. Test with `ping`, `tracert`, and other built-in tools

## 📚 Recommended Follow-ups

- Export the router configurations to `.txt` for version control
- Add documentation for IP address schemes and subnetting
- Create a troubleshooting flowchart for packet loss scenarios
